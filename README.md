## Overview

This project is a data-driven tool designed to predict the outcome of Premier League football matches using **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and API data**. The model analyzes match commentary and statistics to identify features that influence game results.  

Key factors include:  
- **Referee officiating the game** (primary factor)  
- **Team formation** (secondary factor)  
- **Key playersâ€™ frequency in commentary** using a **word cloud** (tertiary factor)  

By analyzing which players are most frequently mentioned in commentary, the project identifies impactful players and their influence on match outcomes.
